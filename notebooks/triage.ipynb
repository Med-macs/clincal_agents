      "Final Assessment: **ESI: 2**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This patient presents with a high-risk chief complaint (chest pain radiating to the left arm) suggestive of a potentially life-threatening condition like Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **High-Risk Situation:** Chest pain, especially with radiation, requires immediate assessment to rule out cardiac ischemia or other critical conditions.\n",
      "*   **Likely Need for Immediate Intervention:** This patient will likely require interventions such as ECG, oxygen, IV access, cardiac monitoring, and potentially medications (aspirin, nitroglycerin, morphine).\n",
      "*   **Not ESI 1:** While the presentation is concerning, the patient's current stability is unknown. If the patient was hypotensive, unresponsive, or in severe respiratory distress, ESI 1 would be more appropriate.\n",
      "*   **Not ESI 3, 4, or 5:** The high-risk nature of the chief complaint and the likely need for multiple resources and interventions within a defined period (minutes to hours) rules out the lower ESI levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Analysis: Okay, here's my differential diagnosis and prioritization based on a 45-year-old male presenting with chest pain radiating to the left arm, ESI 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Priority: HIGH - Immediate evaluation and intervention are required. This patient needs to be seen NOW.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Diagnoses (in order of highest to lowest immediate concern):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - Priority #1:**\n",
      "    *   **Specifically:**\n",
      "        *   **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI):** Complete blockage of a coronary artery.\n",
      "        *   **Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI):** Partial blockage of a coronary artery.\n",
      "        *   **Unstable Angina:** Chest pain at rest or with minimal exertion, indicating a high risk of MI.\n",
      "    *   **Why Highest Priority:** Time is muscle. Rapid diagnosis and intervention (e.g., PCI, thrombolytics) are crucial to minimize myocardial damage and improve outcomes in STEMI and NSTEMI. Unstable angina signifies imminent risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Aortic Dissection - Priority #2:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** Although less likely than ACS in a 45-year-old, this is a catastrophic diagnosis. Radiating chest pain can be a symptom.\n",
      "    *   **Why High Priority:** Aortic dissection requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent death.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - Priority #3:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** Can present with chest pain and, if large, can cause significant hemodynamic instability.\n",
      "    *   **Why High Priority:** Requires rapid diagnosis (e.g., CT angiography) and anticoagulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Esophageal Rupture (Boerhaave Syndrome) - Priority #4:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** While less common, chest pain and potential for mediastinitis make this a serious consideration.  Especially if there's a history of forceful vomiting.\n",
      "    *   **Why Medium Priority:** Requires prompt diagnosis and likely surgical intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Pericarditis - Priority #5:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** Inflammation of the pericardium. Less immediately life-threatening than the above, but still requires diagnosis and treatment. Pain is often sharp and pleuritic, but can sometimes mimic cardiac pain.\n",
      "    *   **Why Medium Priority:** Needs evaluation to rule out other causes and manage pain. Risk of tamponade, though less common, must be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Stable Angina - Priority #6:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** While less acute than ACS, it still requires investigation and management.\n",
      "    *   **Why Medium Priority:** Needs evaluation and potential modification of risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Musculoskeletal Chest Pain - Priority #7:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** A common cause of chest pain, but a diagnosis of exclusion. Must rule out cardiac etiologies first.\n",
      "    *   **Why Low Priority (Once Cardiac Etiology Ruled Out):** Can be managed with analgesics and follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Anxiety/Panic Attack - Priority #8:**\n",
      "    *   **Reasoning:** Can mimic cardiac symptoms. Again, a diagnosis of exclusion.\n",
      "    *   **Why Low Priority (Once Cardiac Etiology Ruled Out):** Requires psychological support and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Actions (Regardless of Specific Diagnosis):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Oxygen:** Apply supplemental oxygen, especially if oxygen saturation is less than 94%.\n",
      "*   **Cardiac Monitor:** Continuous ECG monitoring to identify arrhythmias.\n",
      "*   **IV Access:** Establish at least one, preferably two, IV lines.\n",
      "*   **12-Lead ECG:** Obtain immediately and interpret rapidly. Look for ST-segment elevation, depression, or T-wave inversions.\n",
      "*   **Aspirin:** Administer aspirin 325 mg PO (unless contraindicated).\n",
      "*   **Pain Management:** Address the patient's pain.  Consider morphine or fentanyl (after ECG obtained).\n",
      "*   **Nitroglycerin:** Consider nitroglycerin sublingually or IV (after checking blood pressure and for contraindications such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors).\n",
      "*   **Labs:** Order cardiac enzymes (troponin), CBC, CMP, coagulation studies, and potentially D-dimer if PE is suspected.\n",
      "*   **Chest X-Ray:** To evaluate for pulmonary causes of chest pain, aortic abnormalities, or other structural problems.\n",
      "*   **Focused History:** Obtain a more detailed history, including:\n",
      "    *   Onset, location, duration, character, and radiation of pain\n",
      "    *   Associated symptoms (e.g., diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath)\n",
      "    *   Past medical history, medications, allergies\n",
      "    *   Risk factors for coronary artery disease (e.g., smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, family history)\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a critical situation. Rapid assessment and intervention are paramount.\n"
